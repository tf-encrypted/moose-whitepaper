\section{Introduction}

This paper details the cryptographic techniques and protocols used by Cape Privacy's encrypted learning solution. We expect the reader to have some familiarity with secure multi-party computation, linear algebra, and ring arithmetic; as a good starting point we recommend \cite{evans2017pragmatic}. We also omit detailed explanations of machine learning and the models we support, instead referring the interested reader to~\cite{??}.

Note that this paper is currently scoped to the linear regression. Future versions of the paper will expand upon this with additional models and protocols.
