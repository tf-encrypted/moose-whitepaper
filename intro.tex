\section{Introduction}

This paper details the cryptographic techniques and protocols used by Cape Privacy's encrypted learning solution. 
We expect the reader to have some familiarity with secure multi-party computation, linear algebra and finite field arithmetic; as a good starting point we recommend \cite{evans2017pragmatic}.

This paper is currently scoped to the linear regression task outlined in section~\ref{??}. Future versions of the paper will expand upon this with additional protocols.


\subsection{Linear Regression}

\commentM{TODO: briefly describe the usecase and its high-level computation. }

\commentM{TODO: insert eDSL snippet}

For the linear regression use-case we believe that $128$ bit field size is
enough using a fixed point precision by $16$ bits while keeping the numbers
magnitude to $40$ bits (thus making the integral part of size $24$ bits).
