\section{Introduction}

This paper details the cryptographic techniques and protocols used by Cape
Privacy's encrypted learning solution. We expect the reader to have some
familiarity with secure multi-party computation, linear algebra, and ring
arithmetic; as a good starting point we recommend \cite{evans2017pragmatic}. We
also omit detailed explanations of machine learning and the models we support,
instead referring the interested reader to~\cite{mml}.

The main purpose of this paper is to describe some of the design decisions that went into Moose
and the current MPC protocols that are implemented in it.
