\section{Replicated Protocols}


\subsection{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item three parties, each with two shares
    \item semi-honest security
    \item fixedpoint arithmetic in rings $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{k}}$; concretely, $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{64}}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{128}}$
    \item tensorized version of \cite{CCS:AFLNO16} (is this correct?)
\end{itemize}

For the linear regression use-case we only need to support a limited number of
operations on secret data, most important of this is a large secret matrix-matrix
multiplication.

TODO: briefly describe linear secret sharing

Throughout this section we use 
$$
\share{x}_\ring = \left( (x_1^1, x_2^1), (x_2^2, x_3^2), (x_3^3, x_1^3) \right)
$$ to denote a replicated value consisting of shares $x_1 = x_1^1 = x_1^3$, $x_2 = x_2^2 = x_2^1$, and $x_3 = x_3^3 = x_3^2$ over ring $\ring$ such that $x = \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \in \Z_{2^k}$. It will typically be the case that $P_i$ holds $x_i^i$ and $x_{i+1}^i$ (with indices wrapping around). To ease the notation we occasionally leave the $\ring$ implicit and simply write $\share{x}$. We also often leave out $\ring$ when performing operations on the shares, although these are always done using the corresponding ring arithmetic.
%Note that $\share{x}$ hence also states that the $x_{i+1}$ held by $P_i$ matches the $x_{i+1}$ held by $P_{i+1}$. We furthermore use this to express statements about results of computing on secret shared values such as for instance $\share{\vz} = \share{\vx + \vy} = \share{\vx} + \share{\vy}$.
