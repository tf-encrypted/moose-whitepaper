RSS.}{fig:two-to-three}{Protocol $\Proto{(2,2) \rightarrow (2,3)}$}
Input is $\share{x}$ which is additively shared amongst $P_1$ and $P_2$. Party $P_1$ holds $x_1$ and $P_2$ holds $x_2$ 
such that $x_1 + x_2 = x$. \\
$P_3$ does the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sample seeds $s_1$ and $s_2$ and seeds $s_i$ to $P_i$.
    \item Compute $y_1 \sample \PRG(s_1)$ and $y_3 \sample \PRG(s_2)$.
    \item Set the output share as $(y_3, y_1)$.
 \end{enumerate}

$P_1$ and $P_2$ do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Parties extend the seeds received by $P_1$ computing $\hat{y}_1 \sample \PRG(s_1)$ and $P_2$ computing
   $\hat{y}_3 \sample \PRG(s_2)$.
   \item Compute $x_i - y_i$ and send it to $P_{3-i}$. 
   The received values are denoted by $\tilde{y}_i$.
   \item $P_1$ sets the output share as $(\hat{y}_1, x_1 - \hat{y}_1  + \tilde{y}_1)$
   \item $P_2$ sets the output share as $(x_2 - \hat{y}_2 + \tilde{y}_2, \hat{y}_3)$.
 \end{enumerate}
