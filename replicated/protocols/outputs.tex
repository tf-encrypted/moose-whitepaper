\subsection{Revealing secrets}

We sometimes use interchangeably the terms \textit{open} and \textit{reveal} a secret to refer to taking a replicated tensors $\share{\vx}$ and making it $\vx$ known to a single party  (Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open}) or to all parties (Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open}).
Note that Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open} corresponds to a replicated opening whereas Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open} to an two out of two additive sharing scheme which is used in some more
advanced protocols below for truncation or share conversion. Correctness is guaranteed as long as
the secret was correctly shared. This is also secure as we only send the required
shares to the set of parties that want the secret revealed.
