\subsection{Revealing secrets}

We sometimes use interchangeably the terms \textit{open} and \textit{reveal} a secret to refer to taking a replicated tensor $\share{\vx}$ and making its $\vx$ known to a single party  (Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open}) or to all parties (Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open}).
Note that Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open} corresponds to a replicated opening, whereas Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open} corresponds to a two out of two additive sharing scheme. Additive sharing is used in the truncation and share conversion protocols below. Correctness is guaranteed as long as
the secret was correctly shared. This is also secure, as we only send the required
shares to the set of parties that want the secret revealed.
