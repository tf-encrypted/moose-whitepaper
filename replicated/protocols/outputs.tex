\subsection{Revealing secrets}

We sometimes use interchangeably the terms \textit{open} and \textit{reveal} a
secret to refer to taking a replicated tensor $\share{\vx}$ and making its $\vx$
known to a single party  (Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open}) or to all parties
(Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open}).  Note that Figure~\ref{fig:replicated-open}
corresponds to a replicated opening, whereas Figure~\ref{fig:additive-open}
corresponds to a two out of two additive sharing scheme. Additive sharing is
used in the truncation and share conversion protocols below. Correctness is
guaranteed as long as the secret was correctly shared. This is also secure, as
we only send the required shares to the set of parties that want the secret
revealed.

Note that we also have implemented a variant of revealing to an external party - or a host placement which
is not on the replicated placement. This is a simple case where any two parties $P_i, P_{i+1}$ send their
shares $(x_i^i, x_{i+1}^i, x_{i+2}^{i+1})$ to the external party onto which are then added.
