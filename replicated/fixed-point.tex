\commentM{TODO move this up, perhaps till just after the overview}

We define $\verb|fixed|(k, f)$ as the set of rational numbers $\{x \in \Q : x
= \bar{x} \cdot 2^{-f}, \bar{x} \in \Z_{\share{k}}\}$. Here $\bar{x} \in
Z_{\share{k}}$ denotes that $\bar{x}$ is at most a $k$ bit integer. A fixed
point number is represented in memory as $x \cdot 2^{f} = \bar{x} \in
\Z_{\share{k}}$. There are a few generic protocols to encode, decode or add
and multiply two fixed point numbers but we focus here on truncation while
the interested reader can check more details in
Appendix~\ref{app:fixed-point}.
