\subsection{AES based PRG}
\label{sec:aes}

To sample efficiently a large batch of random bits we use an AES based PRG. 
The main idea is to select a random key $k$ and call $\mathsf{AES}_k(0), \dots, \mathsf{AES}_k(n)$

This is implemented in \textsf{rust/src/prng.rs} and 
In order to sample efficiently a large batch of ring elements we instantiate
the $\RingSample$ command with an AES based PRG. This method of generating
randomness is used in many MPC libraries such as MP-SPDZ, SCALE-MAMBA or Swanky \cite{url-swanky}.
Security proofs for using fixed key AES in various MPC protocols were given in \cite{xiao-paper}.
In our $\RingSample$ after a random key $k$ is generated using the sodiuomxide entropy pool
% then  $\mathsf{AES}_{k}(generate a large chunk of random bits }$

\subsection{$128$ bit field arithmetic}
Currently we only implement 64-bit ring arithmetic ($\Z_{2^{64}}$)
