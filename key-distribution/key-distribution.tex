\section{Simple libsodium description}

The current infrastructure we have is for all parties to generate
a pair of public-secret keys \verb|pk,sk| using libsodium
\begin{verbatim}
crypto_box_keypair(pk, sk)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For simplicity let's assume we have two parties: Alice and Bob who
both have called the \verb|crypto_box_keypair| to own a pair of public-secret keys.
In order for Bob to send a message to Alice he encrypts a message with the following function:
\begin{verbatim}
crypto_box_easy(ciphertext, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN, nonce,
                    bob_publickey, alice_secretkey)
\end{verbatim}

In the \verb|crypto_box_easy| call there are few things that happening, according to \cite{bernstein2009cryptography}
and by also looking at the code \cite{libsodium}.
First, there is an internal call to  \verb|crypto_box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305| which
says that there is a combination of protocols such as:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Curve25519 elliptic-curve-Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret.
  \item After the shared secret $k$ is established than the message \verb|MESSAGE| is encrypted using
  Salsa20 stream cipher keyed with $k$ and nonce \verb|nonce| to produce a ciphertext $c$
  \item In order to keep integrity of the ciphertext then Poly1305 MAC scheme is computed over $c$.
  The MAC scheme and the ciphertext are now concatenated and sent around as \verb|ciphertext| from the output
  of \verb|crypto_box_easy|
\end{enumerate}
